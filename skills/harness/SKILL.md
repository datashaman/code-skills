# Harness

Control surface for the user-scope Claude Code "harness" — feedforward guides (CLAUDE.md, memory), feedback sensors (hooks), and an optional drift-detection loop (snapshot + monthly audit).

The vocabulary follows OpenAI's *Harness engineering* (https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) and Martin Fowler's writeup (https://martinfowler.com/articles/harness-engineering.html). Day-to-day patterns are convergent picks from Boris Cherny, Simon Willison, Jesse Vincent (Superpowers), Geoffrey Huntley (Ralph loop), Hamel Husain (eval skills), and Steve Yegge (Gas Town). See README.md for citations.

## Sub-action dispatch

The user invokes this skill, optionally with an action word. Detect intent and run the matching sub-action. If the user says `/harness` without context, run **status** first (it's read-only and informative), then ask which action they want.

| Said by user                                  | Sub-action  | Script                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| "install", "set up", "bootstrap"              | `install`   | `scripts/install.sh`            |
| "uninstall", "remove", "undo"                 | `uninstall` | `scripts/uninstall.sh`          |
| "update", "pull latest templates", "refresh"  | `update`    | `scripts/update.sh`             |
| "doctor", "diagnose", "is it working"         | `doctor`    | `scripts/doctor.sh`             |
| "snapshot", "backup", "mirror to git"         | `snapshot`  | `scripts/snapshot.sh`           |
| "status", "what's installed", "audit local"   | `status`    | `scripts/status.sh`             |
| "audit", "schedule audit", "monthly check"    | `audit`     | (prep work — see below)         |

Substitute the skill's absolute base directory for `$SKILL_DIR` in every command — it's announced at the top of this invocation.

## install

Lays down the harness at the **scope where the skill itself lives**, derived from `$SKILL_DIR`:

- Skill at `<X>/.claude/skills/harness/` (or under a plugin cache below `<X>/.claude/`) → install at `<X>/.claude/`.
- If `<X>` is `$HOME`, that's user scope; otherwise project scope.
- Override with `--scope=user`, `--scope=project`, or `--target=PATH`.
- If the skill is being run from a checkout (no `.claude/` ancestor), the script errors with a clear message asking for `--scope` or `--target`.

What lands at user scope:

| Surface                  | Path                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operating contract       | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`                                                                              |
| Hooks                    | `~/.claude/hooks/{block-force-push,format-on-edit,post-compact-reinject,verify-before-stop}.sh`     |
| Slash commands           | `~/.claude/commands/{verify,plan}.md`                                                              |
| Auto-memory              | `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/{MEMORY.md, user_role, feedback_concise, feedback_plan_first, feedback_verification}` |
| settings.json            | Adds `env.CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW=400000` + 4 hook entries (uses `~/.claude/hooks/...` form) |

What lands at project scope (`<project>/.claude/`):

| Surface         | Path                                                                                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Operating contract | `<project>/CLAUDE.md` (skipped if it already exists — most projects have one. `--force` overrides) |
| Hooks           | `<project>/.claude/hooks/*.sh`                                                                 |
| Commands        | `<project>/.claude/commands/*.md`                                                              |
| settings.json   | `<project>/.claude/settings.json` — 4 hook entries with `.claude/hooks/...` (project-relative) form. **No env var, no memory** at project scope. |
| Memory          | (skipped — memory is per-user by design and lives under `$HOME` regardless of project scope)   |

```bash
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/install.sh"
```

Common flags:
- `--dry-run` — show the preflight + plan, change nothing.
- `--force` — overwrite existing files (including project CLAUDE.md).

Per-surface skip flags (escape hatch — pick & choose what to install):
- `--skip-claude-md`, `--skip-hooks`, `--skip-commands`, `--skip-memory`, `--skip-settings`

Or a positive list (everything else is skipped):
- `--include=hooks,commands` — install only those.
- `--include=claude-md,settings` — only the operating contract + settings patch.
- Valid items: `claude-md`, `hooks`, `commands`, `memory`, `settings`.

The script always prints a **preflight banner** showing scope, target, the per-surface plan (with SKIP markers reflecting the active flags), and a pointer to the uninstaller with `--all` warnings. Read it before proceeding.

After install, walk the user through the hand-edits printed under "Next steps":

1. Fill in `## Stack signals` in CLAUDE.md.
2. (User scope only) Replace placeholders in `memory/user_role.md` with the user's actual role/projects/stack. **Ask, don't invent.**

Tell them to **restart Claude Code** so hooks load.

After install, walk the user through two hand-edits:

1. `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — fill in the `## Stack signals` section. Look at `~/.claude/projects/` slugs and `installed_plugins.json` for hints; ask if unclear. **Don't auto-fill from guesswork.**
2. `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/user_role.md` — replace placeholders with the user's actual role/projects/stack. **Ask, don't invent.**

Tell them to **restart Claude Code** so hooks load.

## uninstall

```bash
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/uninstall.sh"
```

Same scope auto-detection as install. Conservative defaults:

- Removes hooks + commands **only if their sha256 still matches** the installed template. User-modified files are kept and reported as `keep (modified)`.
- Strips the 4 hook entries from `settings.json`; drops empty hook event arrays. Leaves all other settings untouched.
- **Keeps by default:** `CLAUDE.md`, memory files, the `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_COMPACT_WINDOW` env var.

Flags:
- `--dry-run`, `--force` (skip content-match)
- Broaden the sweep: `--remove-claude-md`, `--remove-memory`, `--remove-env`, `--all`
- **Escape hatch — keep specific surfaces that default would remove:** `--keep-hooks`, `--keep-commands`, `--keep-settings`

The script prints a preflight banner showing scope, target, what will be removed vs kept, and which `--keep-*` / `--remove-*` flags are active. Always run `--dry-run` first if unsure.

Tell the user to **restart Claude Code** so hook deregistration takes effect.

## update

```bash
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/update.sh"
```

Smarter than `install --force`. For each surface compares installed vs current template via sha256 and:

- identical → re-install (no-op cosmetically)
- missing → install
- modified → print diff and **SKIP**, unless `--merge` or `--force`

Flags:
- `--dry-run` — show plan only.
- `--force` — overwrite ALL files including modified ones (loses customisations).
- `--merge` — for modified files, write the new template to `<file>.new` alongside the original. The user can diff/merge interactively.

Default behaviour is non-destructive: you'll see diffs but no customised file is overwritten without consent.

## doctor

```bash
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/doctor.sh"
```

End-to-end diagnostic. Combines `status` with sanity checks:

- sha256 tool present
- target dir writable
- `settings.json` is valid JSON
- all 4 hooks exist, are executable, and are wired in `settings.json`
- hook entries don't point at unexpected paths (foreign installs)
- smoke-test: invoke `block-force-push.sh` with a known-bad command and verify exit code 2
- memory dir populated (user scope)
- `CLAUDE.md` present and `## Stack signals` not still placeholder
- snapshot repo (if `$SNAPSHOT_REPO` set) — last commit recency

Exits non-zero if any FAIL, zero on warnings. Run `doctor` after `install` and after each Claude Code upgrade.

## snapshot

```bash
SNAPSHOT_REPO=~/Projects/<them>/<repo> bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/snapshot.sh"
```

Mirrors `~/.claude/` into a target git repo, scrubs caches and secret patterns, commits + pushes only on diff. Idempotent.

If the user doesn't have a snapshot repo yet, prompt them to create one (PRIVATE — the snapshot has personal config):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Projects/<them>/claude-setup
cd ~/Projects/<them>/claude-setup
git init -b main
gh repo create <them>/claude-setup --private --source=. --remote=origin
```

Then run `snapshot.sh` against it. The first push lands; subsequent runs are no-ops if nothing changed.

Override sources via env: `CLAUDE_DIR=...`, `USER_PROJECT_KEY=...`.

## status

```bash
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/status.sh"
```

Read-only. Reports:

- For each hook + command + memory file + CLAUDE.md: `installed` (matches template), `modified` (customised), or `missing`.
- For `settings.json`: which of the 4 hook entries are wired, plus the env var.
- For snapshot repo (if `SNAPSHOT_REPO` env is set): commits ahead of origin, last snapshot timestamp.

Use `status` first when the user says `/harness` without an action word, when they say "what's installed?", when they say "is this still set up?", or before any `install` to show the diff.

## audit

The audit is a monthly **remote** routine — Claude Code's `/schedule` skill creates it. This skill prepares the prompt and suggests config; the user runs `/schedule` themselves.

Steps:

1. Read `$SKILL_DIR/scripts/audit-prompt.md` — that's the prompt for the remote agent. Confirm with the user that it covers what they want.
2. Suggested config:
   - cron: `0 6 1 * *` (1st of month, 06:00 UTC)
   - model: `claude-opus-4-7` (audit quality matters)
   - tools: Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch, Agent
   - sources: the user's snapshot repo URL (must exist — run `snapshot` first)
3. Tell the user to invoke `/schedule` and paste the prompt + config. Or, if they have `RemoteTrigger` available in their session, build the body and call it directly.

The remote agent clones the snapshot repo, researches the last ~30 days of Anthropic releases and canonical Claude Code voices, and PRs `audits/YYYY-MM-DD-setup-audit.md` with prioritised deltas. It never modifies tracked files outside `audits/`.

## Constraints

- **Never auto-fill stack signals or user_role.** Templates have placeholders; ask the user to fill them.
- **Never modify `settings.json` outside `env` and `hooks`.** Don't touch permissions, marketplaces, statusLine, advisorModel, theme.
- **Memory is sensitive.** If `MEMORY.md` already exists with the user's entries, leave it alone unless they explicitly say otherwise.
- **Snapshot repos must be private.** They contain personal config.
- **Hooks load on session start.** Tell the user to restart Claude Code after install/uninstall.
